# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **Kubeastra**! Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new Kubernetes investigation tool, improving the ReAct agent's reasoning, or building new UI components — your contributions help the entire DevOps community debug smarter.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kubeastra.git
cd kubeastra
```

### 2. Set Up Your Development Environment

**Core engine (`mcp`):**

```bash
cd mcp
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Web UI backend:**

```bash
cd ui/backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env       # then fill in GEMINI_API_KEY or LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
```

**Web UI frontend:**

```bash
cd ui/frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Verify Everything Works

```bash
# Run tests
cd mcp && pytest

# Start the backend (from ui/backend/)
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Start the frontend (from ui/frontend/)
npm run dev
```

You'll need a running Kubernetes cluster (local clusters like kind, minikube, or k3d work fine) and either a Gemini API key or a running Ollama instance. The fastest path is `make demo` from the repo root, which spins up a kind cluster with pre-broken workloads.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Open an issue with:
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce
- Your environment (K8s version, Python version, OS)

### Submitting Code

1. **Check existing issues** — look for `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted` labels
2. **Open an issue first** for significant changes — let's align on the approach before you invest time
3. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
4. **Write tests** for new tools or logic changes
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of what and why

### Where to Make Changes

| I want to... | Look here |
|---|---|
| Add a new kubectl investigation tool | `mcp/k8s/wrappers.py` + register in `mcp_server/tools.py` |
| Improve AI analysis or prompts | `mcp/ai_tools/` + `mcp/services/llm_service.py` |
| Add a new LLM provider | `mcp/services/llm/` (see `base.py` for the interface) |
| Fix chat routing or intent classification | `ui/backend/routers/chat.py` (the `ROUTER_SYSTEM` prompt) |
| Modify the ReAct loop behavior | `ui/backend/react.py` (tool descriptions, prompts, observation truncation, timeout) |
| Add a tool the ReAct agent can use | `ui/backend/react.py` → `TOOL_DESCRIPTIONS` dict + dispatcher |
| Change fix command extraction | `ui/backend/react.py` → `_EXECUTABLE_PREFIXES` + `_extract_actions_from_steps` |
| Add a new cluster connection mode | `ui/backend/routers/cluster.py` + frontend `ClusterConnect` component |
| Update the web interface | `ui/frontend/` (Next.js + TypeScript) |
| Build new result card types | `ui/frontend/components/astra/ResultCard.tsx` |
| Fix shareable session routing | `ui/frontend/app/chat/[sessionId]/page.tsx` + `page-client.tsx` |
| Modify the Helm deployment | `helm/kubeastra/` |
| Add broken workloads to the demo | `demo/broken-workloads/` |

## Adding a New Kubernetes Tool

This is the most common type of contribution. Here's the full checklist:

1. **Add the wrapper function** in `mcp/k8s/wrappers.py` — use `get_runner()` for SSH transparency
2. **Add a Pydantic input schema** in `mcp/mcp_server/schemas.py`
3. **Register in the MCP server** in `mcp/mcp_server/tools.py`
4. **Add to the ReAct agent** in `ui/backend/react.py`:
   - Add to `TOOL_DESCRIPTIONS` dict (one-line description the LLM sees)
   - Add dispatch logic in the tool dispatcher function
   - Optionally add an observation truncation handler in `_truncate_observation`
5. **Add to the keyword router** in `ui/backend/routers/chat.py` (`ROUTER_SYSTEM` prompt) for the direct-tool fallback path
6. **Add tests** in `mcp/tests/`
7. **Update the README** tool count if applicable

```python
# Example: a new tool to check ingress health
def check_ingress_health(namespace: str = "default") -> dict:
    """Check the health and configuration of ingress resources."""
    runner = get_runner()
    result = runner.run(["get", "ingress", "-n", namespace, "-o", "json"])
    result.raise_for_status()
    data = json.loads(result.stdout)
    # ... parse and return structured results
    return {"ingresses": parsed, "issues": issues_found}
```

**If the tool returns large results** (like `get_pods` for all namespaces), add a truncation handler in `react.py` → `_truncate_observation()` that extracts the essential fields. This keeps the ReAct context window manageable.

**Safety rules for write operations:**
- Write tools (delete/scale/restart/patch) must require an explicit `confirm: bool = False` argument
- Write tools must also be gated by `settings.enable_recovery_operations`
- Add the command prefix to `_EXECUTABLE_PREFIXES` in `react.py` so it appears in fix suggestions
- Add the prefix to `_SAFE_KUBECTL_PREFIXES` in `routers/chat.py` so `/api/chat/execute` accepts it
- Every command must be audit-logged (the runner handles this automatically)

## Adding a New LLM Provider

LLM providers live in `mcp/services/llm/`. Each provider implements a common `LLMProvider` interface defined in `base.py`. To add a new provider (e.g. Anthropic Claude):

1. Create `services/llm/anthropic.py` implementing `LLMProvider`
2. Register it in `services/llm/__init__.py` → `get_provider()`
3. Add provider-specific settings to `config/settings.py` (e.g. `anthropic_api_key`)
4. Add the optional SDK dependency to `requirements.txt` (use try-import in the adapter so users who don't need it don't have to install it)
5. Update the `LLM_PROVIDER` docs in the README

---

## Code Standards

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8. Use type hints. Run `ruff check` before submitting.
- **TypeScript/React**: Follow the existing ESLint config (`npm run lint`). Use functional components with hooks.
- **Commits**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages. One logical change per commit.
- **Tests**: New tools and logic changes should include tests. We use `pytest` for Python.

## Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting your PR, make sure:

- [ ] Code follows the project's style guidelines
- [ ] Tests pass locally (`pytest` for Python, `npm test` for frontend)
- [ ] Python files compile cleanly: `python3 -m py_compile <file>`
- [ ] TypeScript compiles cleanly: `npx tsc --noEmit` (from `ui/frontend/`)
- [ ] New tools are registered in `mcp_server/tools.py`, `react.py` (TOOL_DESCRIPTIONS), and `routers/chat.py` (keyword router)
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials, internal URLs, or sensitive config
- [ ] PR description explains what changed and why
- [ ] Read-only safety is preserved (write operations require explicit `confirm=True`)
- [ ] New write command prefixes added to both `_EXECUTABLE_PREFIXES` (react.py) and `_SAFE_KUBECTL_PREFIXES` (chat.py)
- [ ] `.env.example` is updated if you added new config variables

## Good First Issues

New to the project? Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue`. These are scoped, well-defined tasks that are a great way to get familiar with the codebase. Examples:

- Adding a new kubectl wrapper tool (see pattern above)
- Building a new `ResultCard` variant for a resource type (e.g. ingress, configmap)
- Improving ReAct observation truncation for a specific tool in `react.py`
- Adding broken workload examples to `demo/broken-workloads/`
- Expanding test coverage in `mcp/tests/`
- Improving error messages in `ai_tools/analyze.py`
- Adding a new cluster connection mode (e.g. cloud provider SSO)
